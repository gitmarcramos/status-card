A status card for home assistant dashboard

This is my first custom card for Home Assistant.
I am not a coder and have no background in coding. I always tried to achieve something like this with different approaches but nothing was the way in wanted to.
So i tried a bit and i was able to create my own custom card.

This card i highly influenced by [Dwains Dashboard](https://github.com/dwainscheeren/dwains-lovelace-dashboard).
I tried to to have this in every dashboard i want and dont want to be restricted by Dwains Dashboard.

I also made some tweaks so it has some more functions.
I added a graphical Interface to edit the card. Everything is managable from GUI :)

# Features
 - shows person entities
 - shows all entities which aren't off grouped by domain or deivce class
 - filter for areas/floors
 - customization of domains and device classes
 - can show extra entities
 - you can hide certain entities
 - graphical editor
 - should work in all available HA languages

# How does it work?

This card shows every person entity which is present in your HA environment. You can also disable that person entities will be shown.
Also this card goes through a bunch of domains and device classes and looks for the state of all entities inside them.

If the entity is on, home or open (or something else which isn't off) it will show up in the card.
Please keep attention that it will only show entities which are linked to any area. Without this it would be a mess.
